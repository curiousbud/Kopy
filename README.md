## üöÄ Getting Started: Running Locally

To run this project on your local machine, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v20 or later recommended)
*   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (usually comes with Node.js)
*   A Google Cloud project for authentication credentials.

### 1. Installation

First, clone the repository and navigate to the project's root directory. Then, install the necessary packages:

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Set Up Environment Variables

This project uses Next-Auth for authentication, which requires configuration via environment variables.

1.  Create a copy of the example environment file. In your terminal, run:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
2.  Open the newly created `.env` file in your code editor.

3.  **Get Your Google OAuth Credentials:**
    *   Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
    *   Create a new project or select an existing one.
    *   Navigate to **APIs & Services > Credentials**.
    *   Click **Create Credentials > OAuth client ID**.
    *   Select **Web application** as the application type.
    *   Add an "Authorized JavaScript origin": `http://localhost:3000`.
    *   Add an "Authorized redirect URI": `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google`.
    *   Click **Create**. Copy the "Client ID" and "Client Secret".
    *   Paste these values into the `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` variables in your `.env` file.

4.  **Configure Next-Auth Secret:**
    *   You need a secret string to secure your sessions. You can generate one by running the following command in your terminal:
        ```bash
        openssl rand -base64 32
        ```
    *   Copy the output and paste it as the value for `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` in your `.env` file.

5.  Your `.env` file should now look something like this:
    ```
    GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=...
    GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=...
    NEXTAUTH_SECRET=...
    NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
    ```

### 3. Running the Application

You can now start the Next.js development server.

```bash
npm run dev
```

The server will start, typically on `http://localhost:3000`. Open your browser and navigate to this URL to see the application running. You should now be able to sign in with your Google account.

## üìú Available Scripts

In the `package.json` file, you will find several scripts for running and managing the application:

*   `npm run dev`: Starts the Next.js development server.
*   `npm run build`: Builds the application for production.
*   `npm run start`: Starts a production server.
*   `npm run lint`: Lints the project files using ESLint.
